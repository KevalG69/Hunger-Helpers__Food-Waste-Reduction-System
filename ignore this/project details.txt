		Food Waste Reduction System


	Problem: Food waste in restaurants and homes.

	Solution: Build a food-sharing app.
	Connect restaurants with NGOs for surplus food donations.

	Features:

	AI to estimate food waste based on consumption patterns.
	User alerts for expiring food at home.

	Technologies: MERN stack, TensorFlow.js, Twilio API for notifications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	*****Existing Similar Platforms in India:*****

	1.Feeding India (Zomato)
	2.Robin Hood Army

	Focus on: NGO-led surplus food collection.
	Few tech-driven systems directly connecting users, 
	restaurants, and NGOs for donations.

	Usefulness:

	High: Tackles a critical problem in India where food waste is a 
	major issue while many face hunger.
	Restaurants and NGOs benefit greatly from timely food donations.

	Scale of Usage:

	Large: Potential for widespread adoption by NGOs, 
	restaurants, and households if executed well.

	Uniqueness Factor:

	Very high uniqueness, as it combines AI for waste prediction and 
	real-time notifications, which existing platforms don’t provide.

	*****What Other Available System Issues and What lacks*****
	
	
	1. Lack of Real-Time Coordination

	Existing Issue:
	Current platforms rely heavily on manual coordination 
	between restaurants and NGOs, leading to delays.

	2. Limited Prediction and Prevention

	Existing Issue:
	Platforms primarily focus on post-waste management 
	(donating surplus food) rather than waste prevention.


	3. Household-Level Integration

	Existing Issue:
	Most platforms cater only to large-scale donors 
	like restaurants and ignore households.


	4. Lack of Impact Tracking

	Existing Issue:
	Many platforms don’t offer donors insights 
	into the impact of their contributions.


	5. Accessibility and Usability
	Existing Issue:
	Some platforms have complicated interfaces, 
	discouraging participation.

	6. Lack of Automation in Logistics
	Existing Issue:
	Food pickup and delivery are often 
	uncoordinated, requiring manual follow-ups.

	7. Low Awareness Campaigns

	Existing Issue:
	Existing systems rely on passive participation 
	without actively engaging new users.

	
	*****How this System can Solve issues and Fullfill What Other System Lacks*****

	1. Lack of Real-Time Coordination
	
	Solution in this System:
	 1).Real-time notifications for NGOs when surplus food is available.
	 2).Maps integration for tracking food pickup/delivery.

	
	2. Limited Prediction and Prevention

	Solution in this System:
	 1).AI to predict food surplus trends in restaurants based on historical data.
	 2).Suggestions for portion control or donation planning.


	3. Household-Level Integration
	
	Solution in this System:
	 1).Alerts for expiring food items at home to prevent wastage.
	 2).Options for individuals to donate directly to nearby NGOs.

	
	4. Lack of Impact Tracking

	Solution in this System:
	 1).Aalytics dashboard for restaurants and NGOs to track donation 
	     metrics (e.g., amount donated, meals served).
	 2).Visual reports showcasing how donations helped.

	
	5. Accessibility and Usability

	Solution in this System:
	 1).Build a user-friendly, mobile-first design for easy access.
	 2).Support multilingual interfaces to reach diverse users across India.

	
	6. Lack of Automation in Logistics

	Solution in this System:
	 1).Automated scheduling and reminders for pickups.
	 2).Partner with logistics providers or delivery 
	     services (e.g., Swiggy Genie, Dunzo) for seamless operations.

	7. Low Awareness Campaigns

	Solution in this System:
	 1).Gamify food donations by offering badges, recognition, or rewards to donors.
	 2).Use social media integration to encourage users to share their contributions.
